            "* **S. Typhi \"O\" 1:160:**  This indicates a 1:160 dilution of the patient's serum still reacted with the \"O\" antigen of *Salmonella Typhi*.  The \"O\" antigen is a somatic antigen (part of the bacterial cell wall).  A higher titer (dilution) generally suggests a greater antibody response, potentially indicating past or current infection.  The reference range is 1:20; therefore, this result is significantly elevated, suggesting a likely past or current *Salmonella Typhi* infection.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **S. Typhi \"H\" 1:80:** This shows a 1:80 dilution reacted with the \"H\" antigen of *Salmonella Typhi*. The \"H\" antigen is a flagellar antigen (part of the bacterial flagella, or tail).  Again, this titer is elevated compared to the reference range (1:20).\n",

            "* **Dengue NS1 Antigen:** Negative.  NS1 is a non-structural protein produced by the dengue virus.  A negative result means the antigen wasn't detected.\n",
